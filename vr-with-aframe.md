### Today's project

We'll be reimagining Long Lake 58 in 150 years and building a virtual experience to share our vision with others.

### Getting Started

Review: We'll be using these three languages to build our virtual experience.

**HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) defines the structure and content.  
**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheet) is responsible for presentation.  
**JavaScript** is a programming language and controls the behavior and interactions.

>Can you guess which elements in our example projects were built using each of these languages?
