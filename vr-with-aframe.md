## What is VR?

**Virtual Reality** is ----

**Augmented Reality** is ----


## VR Examples

### Why VR?

What's the value in creating these virtual experiences?

Why virtual over real-life experiences?


### VR versus WebVR

**WebVR** is a JavaScript API that makes it possible to experience VR in our browser. We can use WebVR to develop, experience, and share VR projects.

*Another example of an API (Application Programming Interface) is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a>, which allows developers to add customized maps to websites and apps.*


## Intro to A-Frame

**A-Frame** is an open source framework for developing WebVR. A-Frame is based on HTML, using the <a-scene> element. Because it is cross-platform, we can experience A-Frame projects using anything from an Oculus Rift, to the browser on our desktop computer.

Just like other websites, A-Frame projects can be inspected using a built-in visual 3D inspector. We can access this by opening any A-Frame scene, then hitting `<ctrl> + <alt> + i`

### What Can We Create?

Go to [https://aframe.io/](https://aframe.io/) to view example projects that were built using A-Frame.

>Navigate within a scene by using WASD and arrow keys. Click and drag to turn.


### Today's project

We'll be reimagining Long Lake 58 in 150 years and building a virtual experience to share our vision with others.

*Embed example here*


## Getting Started

### Primitives

A-Frame uses HTML elements called **primitives**. These can be customized using HTML attributes (e.g. `color="red"`).

<img alt="primitives" src="img/aframe-primitives.jpg" class="print-hide"/>

* **Position** defines an object's position in 3D space (X,Y,Z)
  * X = left-right
  * Y = up-down
  * Z = forward-back
* **Rotation** defines an object's orientation in 3D space (X,Y,Z) - measured in degrees
  * X = pitch
  * Y = yaw
  * Z = roll

<img alt="rotation" src="img/paper-plane.png" class="print-hide"/>


### Remixing Projects

We'll be using Glitch to edit and save our A-Frame projects.

**Open the Example Project**

1. Go to [https://glitch.com/~aframe](https://glitch.com/~aframe)
1. Select "Remix Your Own" <br> <img alt="remix your own" src="img/aframe-remix.png" class="print-hide"/>
1. Click "Show Live" to preview the project <br> <img alt="show live" src="img/show-live.png" class="print-hide"/>

>How to Navigate: Use the arrow keys to move forwards-backwards and left-right. Click and drag to change the perspective.

**Edit the Code**

1. Go back to the project tab
1. Open index.html. *Anything look familiar?* <br> <img alt="see index" src="img/see-index.png" class="print-hide"/>
1. Sign in with GitHub to begin editing. <br> <img alt="sign in" src="img/sign-in.png" class="print-hide"/>
1. CHALLENGE:
  * Change the colour of the sphere
  * Change the position of the cylinder
  * Change the rotation of the box
  * Add a line of text (see <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/primitives/a-text.html"> A-Frame primitives</a>)





### Think, Pair, Share

Q: Fast forward 150 years! What does Long Lake 58 look like in 2067?

Q: What do you wish for this community, what do you hope to see?
